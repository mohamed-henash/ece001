Artificial Intelligence Applications: -
Social MediaEver since social media has become our identity, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data through chats, tweets, posts and so on. And wherever there is an abundance of data, AI and Machine Learning are always involved.

Artificial Intelligence Applications: Marketing: -
Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is built solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!
In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product.
